# Cluster Detailed View

The Cluster Detailed View in the Runtime Sensor Management feature provides detailed information about the selected cluster and its monitored nodes. To access this feature, simply click on the desired cluster in the Cluster Inventory pane.

The Cluster Detailed View displays information about the selected cluster, including the list of nodes that run under the cluster with their corresponding Runtime Sensor statuses (In Controller Only mode, this will not be available). This capability enables users to track the health of their sensors and quickly identify any potential problems or issues with their cluster infrastructure.
