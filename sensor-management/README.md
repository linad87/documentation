# Sensor Management

The Runtime Sensor Management enables users to install Runtime Controller and Sensors on their clusters, view the clusters that have been installed, and access detailed information about the clusters, nodes, and sensors that monitor them. This capability also provides users with the health status of their sensors and allows them to determine if their environment is being monitored correctly and easily. To access Sensor Management, navigate to the "Sensor Management" section under the "Runtime" menu.
