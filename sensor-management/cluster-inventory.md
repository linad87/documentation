# Cluster Inventory

The Runtime Sensor Management Cluster Inventory allows users to view the status of clusters monitored by JFrog Runtime. To access this feature, navigate to the **Sensor Management** section under the **Runtime** menu.

Once at least one sensor has been installed, the user will be presented with a list that displays the clusters currently being monitored by JFrog Runtime and their status. This capability enables users to track the health of their clusters and take proactive steps to address any potential issues.&#x20;
