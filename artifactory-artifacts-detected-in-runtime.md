# Artifactory Artifacts Detected in Runtime

JFrog Runtime includes a feature that allows users to easily identify artifacts in Artifactory that have are currently running in runtime. When navigating the Artifactory artifacts tree, users can select elements in the tree to view more details. If a specific repository tree element has artifacts that were detected in runtime, a button will appear in the upper right corner of the page indicating the detection of those artifacts. The button also indicates whether any of the detected artifacts have vulnerabilities.

\
By clicking on the button, users will be redirected to [Runtime Live Assessment](live-assessment/) that provides additional information about the detected artifacts, including where they are running, and more. This feature enables users to quickly and easily identify artifacts that are currently running in runtime and take the necessary steps to address any security concerns.
