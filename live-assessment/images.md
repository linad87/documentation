# Images

Images are packaged binary files that contain the necessary code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files required to run applications. They are fundamental building blocks used to create containers in a runtime environment. Our Runtime Live Assessment allows users to trace these images back to their source in JFrog Artifactory, providing insights into their usage and associated vulnerabilities.

The table consists of these main key data:

* **Risk column**: The risk column displays the risk of the riskiest image tag. If in the image tag table there is a separation based on architecture, the risk that appears in the image table should be shown based on the row with the highest risk.&#x20;
* **Vulnerabilities column**: The vulnerabilities column displays the number of vulnerabilities of the riskiest tag that was selected for the risk column.
